RCiIbI is a function which replaces a targeted
color in an image by the pixels at the same position
in a second image. There is the 'tolerance' argument:
if the differance between the sum in of the r,g and b in a pixel
and the sum of the r,g,b of the wanted color is less or equal to the
tolerance, the pixel is changed with the pixel in the second
image, which has been selected.
